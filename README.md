# Results by facet

+ If you want to see how changing the data regime affects the hyperparameter rankings averaged over all games, go to the [main page](https://consistent-hparams.streamlit.app/)
+ If you want to see an analysis for a specific environment/game, exploring how changing different hyperparameter values affect the performances of the algorithms in different data regimes, go to [Games Comparison](https://consistent-hparams.streamlit.app/Game_Comparison)
+ If you want to analyse how changing a specific hyperparameter value affects the performance of the agents across all games and over the 2 data regimes, go to [Hparams in Depth](https://consistent-hparams.streamlit.app/Hparams_in_depth)
